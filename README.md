Tracking personal spending over time can be difficult, boring, and lonely. It is hard to gauge how much spending is too much. So, we introduce Meowny, a solution to this financial management problem! 
With Meowny, users can make personal accounts to submit weekly expenditures under preset categories, such as food, clothing, transportation, entertainment, personal, and miscellaneous. With this information, Meowny will then calculate spending averages and total spending and generate expenditure reports on community spendings.
